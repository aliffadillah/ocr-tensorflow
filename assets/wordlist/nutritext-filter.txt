How to Understand and Use the Nutrition Facts Label

People look at food labels for a variety of reasons But whatever the reason many consumers would like to know how to use this information more effectively and easily The following labelreading skills are intended to make it easier for you to use the Nutrition Facts labels to make quick informed food decisions to help you choose a healthy diet

Overview  Serving Information  Calories  Nutrients  The Percent Daily Value DV  Nutrition Facts Label Variations

Overview
The information in the main or top section see  of the sample nutrition label below can vary with each food and beverage product it contains productspecific information serving size calories and nutrient information The bottom section contains a footnote that explains the  Daily Value and gives the number of calories used for general nutrition advice

In the Nutrition Facts label below we have colored certain sections to help you focus on those areas that will be explained in detail Note that these colored sections are not on the actual food labels of products you purchase

 Serving Information
 on sample label

When looking at the Nutrition Facts label first take a look at the number of servings in the package servings per container and the serving size Serving sizes are standardized to make it easier to compare similar foods they are provided in familiar units such as cups or pieces followed by the metric amount eg the number of grams g The serving size reflects the amount that people typically eat or drink It is not a recommendation of how much you should eat or drink

Its important to realize that all the nutrient amounts shown on the label including the number of calories refer to the size of the serving Pay attention to the serving size especially how many servings there are in the food package For example you might ask yourself if you are consuming  serving  serving or more In the sample label one serving of lasagna equals  cup If you ate two cups you would be consuming two servings That is two times the calories and nutrients shown in the sample label so you would need to double the nutrient and calorie amounts as well as the DVs to see what you are getting in two servings

 Calories
 on sample label

Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from a serving of this food In the example there are  calories in one serving of lasagna What if you ate the entire package Then you would consume  servings or  calories

To achieve or maintain a healthy body weight balance the number of calories you eat and drink with the number of calories your body uses  calories a day is used as a general guide for nutrition advice Your calorie needs may be higher or lower and vary depending on your age sex height weight and physical activity level Learn your estimated calorie needs at httpswwwmyplategovmyplateplan

Remember The number of servings you consume determines the number of calories you actually eat Eating too many calories per day is linked to overweight and obesity

 Nutrients
 on sample label

Look at section  in the sample label It shows you some key nutrients that impact your health You can use the label to support your personal dietary needs  look for foods that contain more of the nutrients you want to get more of and less of the nutrients you may want to limit

Nutrients to get less of Saturated Fat Sodium and Added Sugars
Saturated fat sodium and added sugars are nutrients listed on the label that may be associated with adverse health effects  and Americans generally consume too much of them They are identified as nutrients to get less of Eating too much saturated fat and sodium for example is associated with an increased risk of developing some health conditions like cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure Consuming too much added sugars can make it hard to meet important nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits

What are Added Sugars and How are they Different from Total Sugars

Total Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label includes sugars naturally present in many nutritious foods and beverages such as sugar in milk and fruit as well as any added sugars that may be present in the product No Daily Reference Value has been established for total sugars because no recommendation has been made for the total amount to eat in a day

Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label include sugars that are added during the processing of foods such as sucrose or dextrose foods packaged as sweeteners such as table sugar sugars from syrups and honey and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices Diets high in calories from added sugars can make it difficult to meet daily recommended levels of important nutrients while staying within calorie limits

Note Having the word includes before Added Sugars on the label indicates that Added Sugars are included in the number of grams of Total Sugars in the product

For example a container of yogurt with added sweeteners might list

Total Sugars on Sample Label
This means that the product has  grams of Added Sugars and  grams of naturally occurring sugars  for a total of  grams of sugar

Nutrients to get more of Dietary Fiber Vitamin D Calcium Iron and Potassium
Dietary fiber vitamin D calcium iron and potassium are nutrients on the label that Americans generally do not get the recommended amount of They are identified as nutrients to get more of Eating a diet high in dietary fiber can increase the frequency of bowel movements lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels and reduce calorie intake Diets higher in vitamin D calcium iron and potassium can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis anemia and high blood pressure

Remember You can use the label to support your personal dietary needschoose foods that contain more of the nutrients you want to get more of and less of the nutrients you may want to limit


 The Percent Daily Value DV
 on sample label

The  Daily Value DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food The Daily Values are reference amounts expressed in grams milligrams or micrograms of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day

The DV shows how much a nutrient in a serving of a food contributes to a total daily diet

The DV helps you determine if a serving of food is high or low in a nutrient

Do you need to know how to calculate percentages to use the DV No because the label the DV does the math for you It helps you interpret the nutrient numbers grams milligrams or micrograms by putting them all on the same scale for the day DV The DV column doesnt add up vertically to  Instead the DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food It can tell you if a serving of food is high or low in a nutrient and whether a serving of the food contributes a lot or a little to your daily diet for each nutrient

Note some nutrients on the Nutrition Facts label like total sugars and trans fat do not have a DV  they will be discussed later

General Guide to DV

 DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low
 DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high
More often choose foods that are

Higher in DV for Dietary Fiber Vitamin D Calcium Iron and Potassium
Lower in DV for Saturated Fat Sodium and Added Sugars
Example Look at the amount of sodium in one serving listed on the sample nutrition label Is DV of  contributing a lot or a little to your diet Check the General Guide to DV This product contains  DV for sodium which shows that this is a HIGH sodium product it has more than  DV for sodium If you consumed  servings that would provide  of the DV for sodium  nearly threequarters of an entire days worth of sodium

Compare Foods Use DV to compare food products remember to make sure the serving size is the same and more often choose products that are higher in nutrients you want to get more of and lower in nutrients you want to get less of

Understand Nutrient Content Claims Use DV to help distinguish one claim from another such as light low and reduced Simply compare DVs in each food product to see which one is higher or lower in a particular nutrient There is no need to memorize definitions

Dietary TradeOffs You can use the DV to help you make dietary tradeoffs with other foods throughout the day You dont have to give up a favorite food to eat a healthy diet When a food you like is high in saturated fat balance it with foods that are low in saturated fat at other times of the day Also pay attention to how much you eat during the entire day so that the total amount of saturated fat as well as other nutrients you want to limit stays below DV

How the Daily Values Relate to the DVs

Look at the example below for another way to see how the Daily Values DVs relate to the DVs and dietary guidance For each nutrient listed in the table there is a DV a DV and dietary advice or a goal If you follow this dietary advice you will stay within public health experts recommended upper or lower limits for the nutrients listed based on a calorie daily diet

Examples of DVs versus DVs

Based on a  Calorie Diet

Upper Limit  Eat Less than

Upper limit means it is recommended that you stay below or eat less than the Daily Value nutrient amounts listed per day For example the DV for saturated fat is g This amount is  DV for this nutrient What is the goal or dietary advice To eat less than  g or DV each day

Lower Limit  Eat At least

The DV for dietary fiber is g which is  DV This means it is recommended that you eat at least this amount of dietary fiber on most days

Nutrients Without a DV Trans Fats Protein and Total Sugars

Note that Trans fat and Total Sugars do not list a DV on the Nutrition Facts label Protein only lists a DV in specific situations listed below

Trans Fat Experts could not provide a reference value for trans fat nor any other information that FDA believes is sufficient to establish a Daily Value

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans there is evidence that diets higher in trans fat are associated with increased blood levels of lowdensity lipoprotein LDL or bad cholesterolwhich in turn are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease Note most uses of artificial trans fat in the US food supply have been phased out as of 

Protein A DV is required to be listed if a claim is made for protein such as high in protein The DV for protein must also be listed on the label if the product is intended for infants and children under  years of age However if the product is intended for the general population  years of age and older and a claim is not made about protein on the label the DV for protein is not required

Current scientific evidence indicates that protein intake is not a public health concern for adults and children over  years of age in the United States

Total Sugars No Daily Reference Value has been established for Total Sugars because no recommendations have been made for the total amount to eat in a day Keep in mind that the Total Sugars listed on the Nutrition Facts label include naturally occurring sugars like those in fruit and milk as well as Added Sugars

Nutrition Facts Label Variations
Many Nutrition Facts labels on the market will be formatted in the same way as the lasagna label that has been used as an example throughout this page but there are other formats of the label that food manufacturers are permitted to use This final section will present two alternate formats the dualcolumn label and the singleingredient sugar label

In addition to dualcolumn labeling and singleingredient sugar labels there are other label formats which you can explore here

DualColumn Labels

For certain products that are larger than a single serving but that could be consumed in one sitting or multiple sittings manufacturers will have to provide dual column labels to indicate the amounts of calories and nutrients on both a per serving and per package or per unit basis The purpose of this type of dualcolumn labeling is to allow people to easily identify how many calories and nutrients they are getting if they eat or drink the entire packageunit at one time For example a bag of pretzels with  servings per container might have a label that looks like this to show you how many calories and other nutrients would be in one serving and in one package  servings

SingleIngredient Sugar labels

Packages and containers of products such as pure honey pure maple syrup or packages of pure sugar are not required to include a declaration of the number of grams of Added Sugars in a serving of the product but must still include a declaration of the percent Daily Value for Added Sugars Manufacturers are encouraged but not required to use the  symbol immediately following the Added Sugars percent Daily Value on singleingredient sugars which would lead to a footnote explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent Daily Value for Added Sugars Singleingredient sugars and syrups are labeled in this way so that it does not look like more sugars have been added to the product and to ensure that consumers have information about how a serving of these products contributes to the Daily Value for added sugars and to their total diet


Understanding Food Nutrition Labels
The Nutrition Facts label can help you make healthier eating choices and identify nutrientdense foods for a healthy diet Here are some tips to better understand the information on these labels

Learn what to look for on the label
Nutrition label diagram

  Start with the serving information
This tells the size of a single serving and the total number of servings per container The serving size reflects the amount people typically eat or drink

  Check total calories per serving and container
Notice how many calories are contained in one serving Compare this to the number of servings you eat If you eat two servings you double the calories and nutrients

The next sections on a Nutrition Facts label are about the amounts of specific nutrients in the product

  Limit certain nutrients
Check key nutrients and understand what youre looking for

Focus on the amount of saturated and trans fats rather than the amount of total fats Not all fats are bad  
Avoid trans fat When the Nutrition Facts label lists  g of trans fat but includes partially hydrogenated oil in the ingredient list it means the food contains some trans fat but less than  grams per serving So if you eat more than one serving you could end up eating too much trans fat
Total sugars can include both natural and added sugars
Limit the amounts of added sugars saturated fat and sodium you eat
Compare labels on different brands or similar products and choose foods with less of these nutrients when possible
  Get enough of the beneficial nutrients
Make sure you get enough of the nutrients your body needs such as calcium dietary fiber iron potassium and vitamin D

We all need more dietary fiber to help reduce blood cholesterol levels provide us with a feeling of fullness and manage a healthy body weight Adults need at least  grams of fiber daily for good health

  Understand  Daily Value
The  Daily Value DV tells you the percentage of each nutrient in a single serving in terms of the daily recommended amount If you want to consume less of a nutrient such as saturated fat or sodium choose foods with a lower  DV  or less If you want to consume more of a nutrient such as fiber choose foods with a higher  DV  or more

The information shown on the label is based on a diet of  calories a day You may need less or more than  calories depending upon your age gender activity level and whether youre trying to lose gain or maintain your weight

The US Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods and drinks In  the FDA released changes to the label to make it easier to see how many calories and added sugars are in a product and to make serving sizes more realistic As of January  all food manufacturers were required to make these changes on the Nutrition Facts labels on their products

How to Read Food Labels Without Being Tricked
Look on the Back
Ingredients List
Serving Sizes
Misleading Claims
Names for Sugar
Bottom Line
Reading labels can be tricky

Consumers are more healthconscious than ever so some food manufacturers use misleading tricks to convince people to buy highly processed and unhealthy products

Food labeling regulations are complex making it harder for consumers to understand them

This article explains how to read food labels so that you can differentiate between mislabeled junk and truly healthy foods

Dont Let the Claims on the Front Fool You
One of the best tips may be to completely ignore claims on the front of the packaging

Front labels try to lure you into purchasing products by making health claims

In fact research shows that adding health claims to front labels makes people believe a product is healthier than the same product that doesnt list health claims  thus affecting consumer choices Trusted Source Trusted Source Trusted Source Trusted Source

Manufacturers are often dishonest in the way they use these labels They tend to use health claims that are misleading and in some cases downright false

Examples include many highsugar breakfast cereals like wholegrain Cocoa Puffs Despite what the label may imply these products are not healthy

This makes it hard for consumers to choose healthy options without a thorough inspection of the ingredients list

SUMMARY
Front labels are often used to lure people into buying products However some of these labels are highly misleading

Study the Ingredients List
Product ingredients are listed by quantity  from highest to lowest amount

This means that the first ingredient is what the manufacturer used the most of

A good rule of thumb is to scan the first three ingredients as they make up the largest part of what youre eating

If the first ingredients include refined grains a type of sugar or hydrogenated oils you can assume that the product is unhealthy

Instead try choosing items that have whole foods listed as the first three ingredients

In addition an ingredients list that is longer than two to three lines suggests that the product is highly processed

SUMMARY
Ingredients are listed by quantity  from highest to lowest Try looking for products that list whole foods as the first three ingredients and be skeptical of foods with long lists of ingredients

Watch out for Serving Sizes
Nutrition labels state how many calories and nutrients are in a standard amount of the product  often a suggested single serving

However these serving sizes are frequently much smaller than what people consume in one sitting

For example one serving may be half a can of soda a quarter of a cookie half a chocolate bar or a single biscuit

In doing so manufacturers try to deceive consumers into thinking that the food has fewer calories and less sugar

Many people are unaware of this serving size scheme assuming that the entire container is a single serving when in truth it may consist of two three or more servings

If youre interested in knowing the nutritional value of what youre eating you need to multiply the serving given on the back by the number of servings you consumed

SUMMARY
Serving sizes listed on packaging may be misleading and unrealistic Manufacturers often list a much smaller amount than what most people consume in one setting

The Most Misleading Claims
Health claims on packaged food are designed to catch your attention and convince you that the product is healthy

Here are some of the most common claims  and what they mean

Light Light products are processed to reduce either calories or fat Some products are simply watered down Check carefully to see if anything has been added instead  like sugar
Multigrain This sounds very healthy but only means that a product contains more than one type of grain These are most likely refined grains  unless the product is marked as whole grain
Natural This does not necessarily mean that the product resembles anything natural It simply indicates that at one point the manufacturer worked with a natural source like apples or rice
Organic This label says very little about whether a product is healthy For example organic sugar is still sugar
No added sugar Some products are naturally high in sugar The fact that they dont have added sugar doesnt mean theyre healthy Unhealthy sugar substitutes may also have been added
Lowcalorie Lowcalorie products have to have onethird fewer calories than the brands original product Yet one brands lowcalorie version may have similar calories as another brands original
Lowfat This label usually means that the fat has been reduced at the cost of adding more sugar Be very careful and read the ingredients list
Lowcarb Recently lowcarb diets have been linked to improved health Still processed foods that are labeled lowcarb are usually still processed junk foods similar to processed lowfat foods
Made with whole grains The product may contain very little whole grains Check the ingredients list  if whole grains arent in the first three ingredients the amount is negligible
Fortified or enriched This means that some nutrients have been added to the product For example vitamin D is often added to milk Yet just because something is fortified doesnt make it healthy
Glutenfree Glutenfree doesnt mean healthy The product simply doesnt contain wheat spelt rye or barley Many glutenfree foods are highly processed and loaded with unhealthy fats and sugar
Fruitflavored Many processed foods have a name that refers to a natural flavor such as strawberry yogurt However the product may not contain any fruit  only chemicals designed to taste like fruit
Zero trans fat This phrase means less than  grams of trans fat per serving Thus if serving sizes are misleadingly small the product may still contain trans fat Trusted Source
Despite these cautionary words many truly healthy foods are organic whole grain or natural Still just because a label makes certain claims doesnt guarantee that its healthy

SUMMARY
Many marketing terms are associated with improved health These are often used to mislead consumers into thinking that unhealthy processed food is good for them

Different Names for Sugar
Sugar goes by countless names  many of which you may not recognize

Food manufacturers use this to their advantage by purposely adding many different types of sugar to their products to hide the actual amount

In doing so they can list a healthier ingredient at the top mentioning sugar further down So even though a product may be loaded with sugar it doesnt necessarily appear as one of the first three ingredients

To avoid accidentally consuming a lot of sugar watch out for the following names of sugar in ingredient lists

Types of sugar beet sugar brown sugar buttered sugar cane sugar caster sugar coconut sugar date sugar golden sugar invert sugar muscovado sugar organic raw sugar raspadura sugar evaporated cane juice and confectioners sugar
Types of syrup carob syrup golden syrup highfructose corn syrup honey agave nectar malt syrup maple syrup oat syrup rice bran syrup and rice syrup
Other added sugars barley malt molasses cane juice crystals lactose corn sweetener crystalline fructose dextran malt powder ethyl maltol fructose fruit juice concentrate galactose glucose disaccharides maltodextrin and maltose
Many more names for sugar exist but these are the most common

If you see any of these in the top spots on the ingredients lists  or several kinds throughout the list  then the product is high in added sugar

SUMMARY
Sugar goes by various names  many of which you may not recognize These include cane sugar invert sugar corn sweetener dextran molasses malt syrup maltose and evaporated cane juice

The Bottom Line
The best way to avoid being misled by product labels is to avoid processed foods altogether After all whole food doesnt need an ingredients list

Still if you decide to buy packaged foods be sure to sort out the junk from the higherquality products with the helpful tips in this article


Food labels
Nutrition information labels can help you choose between products and keep a check on the amount of foods youre eating that are high in fat salt and added sugars

Most prepacked foods have a nutrition information label on the back or side of the packaging

You can use nutrition information labels to help you eat a balanced diet

If youre choosing foods and drinks that are high in fat salt and sugar have these less often and in small amounts

Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories too much fat sugar and salt and not enough fruit vegetables oily fish or fibre

Nutrition information labels on the back or side of packaging
Most prepacked foods have a nutrition information label on the back or side of the packaging These labels must include the amount of energy in kilojoules kJ and kilocalories kcal usually referred to as calories

They must also include information on fat saturates saturated fat carbohydrate sugars protein and salt They may also include other nutrients like fibre

All nutrition information is provided per  grams or per  millilitres and sometimes per portion of the food or drink

How do I know if a food is high in fat saturated fat sugar or salt
There are guidelines to tell you if a food is high in fat saturated fat salt sugar or not

These are

Total fat
High more than g of fat per g
Low g of fat or less per g

Saturated fat
High more than g of saturated fat per g
Low g of saturated fat or less per g

Sugars
High more than g of total sugars per g
Low g of total sugars or less per g

Salt
High more than g of salt per g or g sodium
Low g of salt or less per g or g sodium

For example if youre trying to cut down on saturated fat eat fewer foods that have more than g of saturated fat per g

Different criteria are used to determine whether a drink is high or low in fat saturated fat sugar or salt

Some nutrition information labels on the back or side of packaging also provide information about reference intakes

Nutrition labels on the front of packaging
Many supermarkets and food manufacturers now also highlight the energy fat saturated fat sugars and salt content on the front of the packaging alongside the reference intake for each of these

This is very useful when you want to compare different food and drink products at a glance

Frontofpack labels usually give a quick guide to

energy calories
fat content
saturated fat content
sugars content
salt content
These labels provide information on the number of grams of fat saturated fat sugars and salt and the amount of energy in kJ and kcal in a serving or portion of the food or drink It may also provide the amount of kJ and kcal per g or per ml

But be aware that the manufacturers idea of a portion may be different from yours

Some frontofpack nutrition labels also provide information about reference intakes

Red amber and green colour coding
Example of traffic light food labelling from a burgerCredit
NHSDAnnabel King

Some frontofpack nutrition labels use red amber and green colour coding

Colourcoded nutritional information tells you at a glance if the food has high medium or low amounts of fat saturated fat sugars and salt

red means high
amber means medium
green means low
In general a food or drink that has all or mostly green on the label is a healthier choice

Amber means neither high nor low so you can eat foods with all or mostly amber on the label most of the time

But any red on the label means the food is high in fat saturated fat salt or sugars and you should limit your intake of these foods and drinks

Try to eat these foods less often and in small amounts

Reference intakes
Nutrition labels can also provide information on how a particular food or drink product fits into your daily recommended diet

Reference intakes are guidelines about the approximate amount of particular nutrients and energy required for a healthy diet

Ingredients list
Prepacked food products must have a list of ingredients with allergens highlighted on the packaging or an attached label

The ingredients list can also help you work out how healthy the product is

Ingredients must be listed in descending order of weight so the main ingredients in the packaged food always come first

That means that if the first few ingredients are highfat ingredients such as cream butter or oil then the food in question is likely to be a highfat food

Food shopping tips
Youre standing in the supermarket aisle looking at  similar products trying to decide which to choose You want to make the healthier choice but youre in a hurry

If youre buying prepackaged or ready meals check to see if theres a nutrition label on the front of the pack and then see how your choices stack up when it comes to the amount of energy fat saturated fat sugars and salt

If the nutrition labels use colour coding youll often find a mixture of red amber and green

So when youre choosing between similar products try to go for more greens and ambers and fewer reds if you want to make a healthier choice

What information is on the food label
The label on a packaged food will tell you

the name and brand of the product
what ingredients it contains listed in order from largest to smallest by weight  this includes a list of food additives and information for people with food allergies
nutrition information such as average amount of energy fat protein sugars and salt
percentage labelling how much of the main ingredients it contains so you can compare it to other products
useby or bestbefore date and directions for use and storage
details of the manufacturer and the country where the food was produced
how much it weighs
In Australia all manufactured foods have to have labels containing safety and nutrition information by law This information helps you to make decisions about the food you buy and eat so you can follow a healthy diet

Understanding nutrition claims
Most labels tell you what percentage of the main ingredients are in packaged foods If there is an ingredient that is known to cause allergies it must be written no matter how much is used This helps you to compare similar products easily and work out how the food fits into a balanced diet Read more about recommended daily intakes for adults and recommended daily intakes for children

The label may make a number of nutrition claims such as gluten free low GI low fat reduced salt or high fibre These mean the product meets strict criteria set by the government Even if a product makes a nutrition claim this doesnt mean that it is healthy For example a product that is low fat may have more kilojoules energy than another similar product Check the nutrition information panel to see how the product compares

How to read the nutrition information panel
The nutrition information panel tells you the size of a standard serving of the product and which nutrients are included in that serving You can use the label to compare the product with whats in similar packaged foods

Look out for information about

Energy A kilojoule is a measure of energy To lose weight you need to eat and drink fewer kilojoules kJ than you use You should limit your intake of discretionary or junk foods  for example those that have more than kJ per serve
Protein Protein is found in meat poultry dairy fish eggs beans soy nuts and seeds Protein is important for growth and has the same amount of kilojoules as carbohydrates
Fat total Fat is higher in kilojoules than other nutrients so you should limit the total amount you eat
Saturated fat There are different types of fats Saturated fats are linked to a higher risk of heart disease and high blood cholesterol so it is especially important to choose foods low in saturated fat
Carbohydrate total Carbohydrates are found in all fruit and vegetables all breads and grain products and sugar and sugary foods You need carbohydrates for energy
Sugar Sugar is a type of carbohydrate It is better to choose healthier carbohydrates and to limit foods that are high in added sugars
Healthy carbohydrates Healthier carbohydrates are those that are not process or minimally processed such as whole grains lentils and beans As well as carbohydrates these foods also give you fibre vitamins and minerals
Fibre High fibre foods such as wholegrain bread and cereals improve digestion and help you to feel full
Sodium This tells you how much salt the product contains Eating too much salt is linked to high blood pressure and can lead to heart disease stroke and kidney disease
Nutrition Information Panel

Comparing products
To compare similar products it is best to look in the column on the nutrition information panel that shows the quantity of a nutrient per g or per ml so you know you are comparing the same thing

For most people healthier options include products that have lower levels of saturated fat sugar and sodium salt per g and higher levels of fibre

Its a good idea to look at the food as a whole rather than just one nutrient when comparing products

Health Star Rating HSR system
The Health Star Rating on the front of the pack is designed to help you choose healthier packaged foods quickly

Health Star Rating System HSR
And example of a Health Star Rating for packaged food Watch the video to on how to read and compare the Health Star Rating of packaged products
Packaged foods are rated at between  and  stars The rating is calculated according to ingredients that increase the risk of obesity and are linked to other chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease The more stars the healthier the product

The health stars are designed to help you compare similar packaged products For example they might help you choose the healthiest breakfast cereal but not to compare breakfast cereal with yoghurt

Remember the Health Star Rating is a guide to help you make healthier choices of packaged foods For a healthy balanced diet you need to eat protein rich foods like lean meat poultry and dairy products and a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables which usually dont have a Health Star Rating

Reading Food Labels
Making Sense of Food Labels
Trying to figure out nutritional information on labels and packaging isnt easy The good news is that we can help These food labels are especially helpful if you use carb counting to plan your meals

If you get tripped up on food content claims youre not alone Fat free vs low fat vs reduced fat Low cholesterol vs reduced cholesterol Its confusing and it can be tough when youre trying to make the right choices

Serving size
Start by looking at the serving size All of the information on the label is based on the serving size listed If you eat more that means youll be getting more calories carbohydrates etc than what is listed

Amount per serving
The information on the left side of the label tells you the total of the different nutrients in one serving of the food Use these numbers to compare labels of similar foods

Calories
Calories are a unit of energythink of them as the energy your body consumes and uses for bodily functions Curious how many calories you need Talk with a registered dietitian nutritionist RDRDN

Total carbohydrate
Total carbohydrate on the label includes all three types of carbohydrate sugar starch and fiber Its important to use the total grams when counting carbs or choosing which foods to include Below the Total Carbohydrate carbs you will find a breakdown of the types of carbohydrate in the food Learn more about carbs

Added sugar
One of the three types of carbohydrates in food is sugar As of January  labels must include added sugar to help you know the difference between sugar that occurs naturally in the food like yogurt or fruit and sugar that was added during processing like in cookies candy and soda Many labels have already made the change Learn more about sugar and the three main types of carbohydrates

Fiber
Fiber is the part of plant foods that is not digestedor for some types only partially digested Dried beans such as kidney or pinto beans fruits vegetables and whole intact grains are all good sources of fiber The amount of fiber you need depends on your age and gender Healthy adults need between  and  grams of fiber a day on averageyou can find recommendations for your age group and gender in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans DGA Learn more about fiber and the three main types of carbohydrates

Sugar alcohols
Sugar alcohols are a type of sugar substitute that have fewer calories per gram than sugars and starches Sorbitol xylitol and mannitol are examples of sugar alcohols If a food contains sugar alcohols it would be listed on the label under Total Carbohydrate Its important to keep in mind that foods that contain sugar alcohols are not necessarily low in carbohydrate or calories And just because a package says sugarfree on the outside does not mean that it is calorie or carbohydratefree Always check the label for the grams of total carbohydrate and calories

Fats
Total fat tells you how much fat is in one serving of the food In general when it comes to fat try to replace foods high in saturated fat or trans fat with foods rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to reduce your risk of heart disease Learn more about fats

Sodium
Sodium is the scientific term for salt It does not affect blood sugar However excess dietary sodium increases your risk of high blood pressure and heart disease With some foods you can taste how salty they are such as pickles or bacon But there is also hidden salt in many foods like salad dressings lunch meat canned soups and other packaged foods Reading labels can help you find these hidden sources and compare the sodium in different foods Whether you have diabetes or not  milligrams mg or less per day is the general recommendation If you have high blood pressure talk with your health care team to find out the best goal for you

List of ingredients
Ingredient lists can be a helpful tool Ingredients are listed in order by weight with the first ingredient being the highest amount in the food Knowing the ingredients is useful in making healthy choices like increasing fiber look for words like whole grain whole wheat etc or decreasing sugar look for words like cane sugar agave maple syrup honey etc

Percent Daily Values DV
The Percent Daily Values for each nutrient are found in the right column on the label These tell you what percent of each nutrient the food provides if you were on a  calorie per day diet  As a general rule of thumb aim for less than  for nutrients you want to limit such as sodium and saturated fat Aim for  or more for nutrients you want to get more of such as fiber vitamin D calcium and iron

Net carbs and Other Nutrient Claim Meanings

Overview
The Nutrition Facts Label on packaged foods is based on dietary recommendations for Americans The US Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates what goes on the Nutrition Facts Label Below are explanations of parts of the label and some tips for using it to follow healthy eating patterns

Example of the nutrition facts label
This label is required on all packaged foods made in the United States and imported from other countries
Serving size
The serving size reflects what people are likely to eat or drink This is not necessarily the portion you should eat For example one serving size of ice cream is labeled as  cup A ounce or ounce bottle of soda is labeled as one serving

Be sure you know how many servings are in packaged food For example if you buy what looks like an individual sized chicken pie check the Nutrition Facts Label It might actually be two servings with double the calories and sodium of a single serving

Dual Column Labels
Some food and drink packages that contain more than one serving may have a dual column Nutrition Facts Label In that case one column on the Nutrition Facts Label may provide calorie and nutrition information for one serving Another column may provide calorie and nutrition information for the whole package

Calories and fat
Larger darker letters make calories the easiest item to see

When it comes to health outcomes the type of fat you eat matters more than the overall amount of fat The Nutrition Facts Label shows total fat in grams and percentages of calories from fat

The Nutrition Facts Label has separate lines for saturated and trans fats which are less healthy than other types of fat Look for foods with very little saturated and trans fats

Sodium
The recommended daily limit for sodium is  milligrams The Nutrition Facts Label indicates the number of milligrams of sodium in a serving

Most sodium we consume is from salt which is a common ingredient in processed foods Read the Nutrition Facts Labels and choose the product with less sodium

Tips for Reducing Sodium Intake
Added Sugars
The Nutrition Facts Label shows the percentage of calories from added sugars Naturally occurring sugars such as those in fruit or milk are not added sugars Added sugars include brown sugar maple sugar corn sweetener corn syrup honey malt syrup and molasses

The two main sources of added sugars in the United States are sugary drinks and dessertssweet snacks Keep your intake of added sugars to less than  of your total daily calories That means if you consume  calories in a day added sugars should account for no more than  calories

If you eat even one large dessert or sugary drink per day you are likely getting more than the recommended daily limit of added sugar Try drinking plain water instead of sugary drinks and limiting the serving size of treats See how to Rethink Your Drink and Be Sugar Smart

Nutrients
The amount of these nutrients are required to be on the Nutrition Facts Label

Vitamin D
Calcium
Iron
Potassium
Food producers can voluntarily include vitamins A and C

Cara Membaca Informasi Nilai Gizi pada Kemasan Makanan
Informasi nilai gizi nutrition facts adalah label pada kemasan makanan atau minuman yang mencantumkan kandungan gizi produknya Keterangan pada label ini sangat bermanfaat bagi seseorang yang sedang membatasi asupan kalori Mengingat banyaknya nilai gizi pada label ini tidak heran bila banyak orang kesulitan membacanya

Cara mudah membaca informasi nilai gizi
Di bawah ini berbagai komponen dalam label informasi gizi pada kemasan makanan dan minuman serta penjelasan lengkapnya

 Jumlah sajian per kemasan
Setiap informasi nilai gizi menggambarkan kandungan gizi untuk satu sajian bukan satu kemasan

Satu kemasan makanan satu bungkus kotak atau kaleng biasanya memiliki lebih dari satu sajian Jumlah sajian per kemasan menunjukkan jumlah takaran saji yang terdapat dalam satu kemasan makanan

Ambil contoh suatu produk keripik kentang memiliki keterangan  sajian per kemasan Ini artinya setiap satu kemasan bisa dibagi menjadi  sajian atau dikonsumsi sebanyak  kali dengan tiap frekuensi konsumsi menghabiskan satu sajian

Jika Anda makan satu bungkus snack kemasan tersebut hingga habis Anda mendapat asupan gizi berjumlah  kali lipat dari nilai yang tertera pada kemasan

Begitu pun bila Anda makan dua bungkus keripik kentang tersebut asupan kalori dan gizi yang Anda dapat menjadi  kali lipat

 Kalori total per sajian
cra hitung kalori makanan kemasan

Kalori total pada informasi nilai gizi menunjukkan banyaknya energi yang akan Anda dapatkan dari setiap sajian makanan atau minuman

Semakin banyak sajian produk yang Anda konsumsi semakin besar pula asupan kalori yang Anda dapatkan

Penulisan kalori biasanya disertai keterangan kalori dari lemak yang sudah termasuk ke dalam kalori total Sebagai contoh sebungkus makaroni punya keterangan kalori total per sajian sebanyak  kkal dan kalori dari lemak sebanyak  kkal

Apabila Anda mengonsumsi satu sajian makaroni tersebut Anda akan memperoleh energi total sebanyak  kkal

Dari angka tersebut sebanyak  kkal berasal dari lemak sedangkan sisanya berasal dari karbohidrat dan protein

Kalori harian pada informasi nilai gizi biasanya merujuk angka kebutuhan kalori per hari atau sebesar  kkal

Makanan berkalori tinggi dan rendah
Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan Amerika Serikat FDA mengelompokkan tingkat kalori makanan kemasan dengan ketentuan berikut
Rendah jika jumlah kalori mendekati atau sekitar 
Sedang jika jumlah kalori mendekati atau sekitar 
Tinggi jika jumlah kalori mendekati atau sekitar 
 Angka kecukupan gizi AKG
Angka kecukupan gizi AKG pada informasi nilai gizi merujuk pada kebutuhan energi harian ratarata yaitu sebesar  kkal

Nilai ini menunjukkan jumlah zat gizi dalam satuan berat seperti miligram mg atau gram gr atau disajikan dalam bentuk persentase  AKG

Setiap zat gizi memiliki rekomendasi asupan harian masingmasing Sementara itu persentase AKG yaitu perbandingan antara zat gizi dalam suatu produk dengan total zat gizi yang Anda butuhkan

Ada satu kotak jus jeruk yang terdiri dari satu sajian Produk ini mengandung vitamin C yang setara dengan  AKG per sajian

Dengan mengonsumsi satu kotak jus jeruk tersebut Anda telah memenuhi  kebutuhan vitamin C per hari

Mengenali zat gizi dalam suatu produk
cara membaca label nutrisi makanan atau informasi nilai gizi

Selain mengetahui cara membaca informasi nilai gizi Anda sebaiknya juga mengenali zat gizi apa saja yang perlu dipenuhi dan dibatasi

  Kandungan gizi yang harus dibatasi
Beberapa kandungan yang harus dibatasi dari makanan kemasan yakni lemak jenuh lemak trans gula tambahan dan garam natrium

Keempatnya biasanya sudah terpenuhi dari makanan seharihari jadi asupan dari makanan kemasan perlu dibatasi

Asupan berlebihan justru dapat meningkatkan risiko berbagai penyakit kronis seperti penyakit jantung hipertensi dan kanker

Untuk mempermudah Anda carilah makanan kemasan yang kandungan lemak gula dan natriumnya kurang dari  AKG

Perlu diketahui bahwa label informasi nilai gizi tak selalu mencantumkan zat gizi dalam persen AKG melainkan dalam satuan gram

Meski begitu prinsipnya tetap sama yaitu Anda perlu mengonsumsi zat gizi sesuai kebutuhan yang ada dalam AKG

 Kandungan gizi yang harus dipenuhi
Tubuh memerlukan karbohidrat protein lemak vitamin dan mineral untuk menjalankan seluruh fungsinya

Selain itu zat gizi mempunyai peran penting untuk menurunkan risiko berbagai gangguan kesehatan

Asupan mineral kalsium dan mineral fosfor yang cukup bisa mencegah pengeroposan tulang atau vitamin C penting untuk sistem imun

Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan nutrisinya pilihlah produk dengan kecukupan gizi sekitar  AKG atau lebih

Memperhatikan komposisi makanan
Satu lagi komponen yang tidak kalah penting dari informasi nilai gizi yakni komposisi makanan

Produk yang mengandung berbagai bahan biasanya memiliki keterangan ini Umumnya semua bahan diurutkan dari jumlah terbanyak hingga yang paling sedikit

Membaca komposisi makanan amat bermanfaat bagi Anda yang harus memperhatikan asupan zat gizi tertentu

Salah satu contoh orang yang perlu mengurangi konsumsi gula juga perlu menghindari pemanis buatan seperti aspartam dan corn syrup

Label informasi nilai gizi merupakan komponen penting dalam suatu kemasan produk makanan dan minuman Dari situlah Anda bisa mengetahui jumlah kalori dan berbagai zat gizi yang penting

Semua informasi tersebut dihitung secara akurat menurut sajian per kemasan Dengan membaca label informasi ini Anda secara tidak langsung juga berperan aktif dalam menjaga kesehatan tubuh Anda

Begini Cara Membaca Tabel Informasi Nilai Gizi Mudah Kok

Informasi nilai gizi ditulis dalam bentuk tabel yang terletak di bagian samping atau belakang kemasan makanan Tabel ini berguna sebagai informasi apa saja kandungan gizi yang terdapat pada makanan atau minuman tersebut

Pada dasarnya ada banyak tulisan dan angka yang tercantum dalam tabel ini sehingga tidak sedikit yang masih belum paham bagaimana cara membacanya apakah Anda salah satunya

Jika demikian berikut MinMeal sampaikan bagaimana cara membaca informasi nilai gizi pada kemasan makanan

Daftar Isi
Cara Mudah Membaca Label Nutrisi
Berikut ini adalah aspek penting yang tercantum dalam tabel informasi nilai gizi yang perlu Anda perhatikan

 Jumlah Sajian per Kemasan
Pada umumnya informasi nilai gizi ditulis berdasarkan pada satu kali penyajian Jika ada makanan dan minuman dalam kemasan besar biasanya memiliki beberapa kali jumlah sajian Maksudnya dalam satu kemasan tidak dianjurkan untuk dihabiskan sekaligus oleh satu orang

Contohnya satu kemasan biskuit dengan ukuran  gram memiliki keterangan  sajian per kemasan artinya dalam satu kemasan bisa dibagi menjadi  kali makan

Jadi jika Anda langsung menghabiskan biskuit tersebut dalam satu waktu sekaligus Anda mendapat zat gizi  kali lipat dari yang tertera pada tabel

 Kalori Total per Sajian
Kalori merupakan satuan dari energi yang dibutuhkan tubuh agar bisa beraktivitas seharihari

Kalori yang tercantum pada informasi nilai gizi berlaku untuk satu sajian per kemasan Seperti pembahasan di awal jika pada kemasan tercantum  sajian per kemasan maka jumlah total kalori dalam kemasan biskuit tadi adalah  kali lipatnya

Keterangan kalori ini ditulis sebagai energi dan dibagi menjadi dua jenis yaitu energi total dan energi dari lemak Misalnya energi total tertulis  kkal dan energi dari lemak  kkal itu artinya dalam satu sajian Anda akan mendapat  kalori yang mana  diantaranya berasal dari lemak

 Kandungan Gizi
Selain jumlah sajian dan kalori per kemasan sejumlah kandungan gizi juga tertulis dalam tabel antara lain lemak protein karbohidrat garam dan vitamin atau mineral lainnya jika terdapat pada makanan

Karena penulisan informasi gizi ini tidak bisa sembarangan Anda bisa mengkonfirmasi kebenaran dari apa yang dipasarkan merk dengan kondisi asli makanan Jika di sebuah iklan minyak goreng disebutkan mengandung vitamin A Anda bisa melihatnya di tabel gizi yang tercentum jika benar tentu akan tertulis vitamin A beserta persentasenya

 Angka Kecukupan Gizi AKG
Angka Kecukupan Gizi AKG adalah jumlah kalori atau energi harian yang dibutuhkan ratarata kebutuhan setiap individu di Indonesia adalah  kkal dalam sehari

Jumlah AKG pada informasi nilai gizi disajikan dalam bentuk persentase ini akan memudahkan Anda mengetahui apakah jumlah gizi Anda sudah cukup setelah mengkonsumsi makanan kemasan tersebut

Sebagai contoh pada kemasan biskuit tadi tertulis protein  gram dan persentase  artinya dengan mengkonsumsi satu sajian biskuit Anda sudah memenuhi  dari kebutuhan protein dalam sehari

Perhatikan Komposisi Makanan
Selain membaca informasi nilai gizi Anda juga perlu perhatikan apa saja komposisi yang terkandung dalam kemasan makanan tersebut

Makanan kemasan biasa mengandung banyak bahan penyusun seperti pengawet dan pemanis tambahan serta penguat rasa

Kandungan gula garam dan lemak adalah beberapa yang harus dibatasi konsumsinya karena sejatinya kita sudah mendapat zat gizi tersebut dari makanan seharihari selain dari makanan kemasan

Penting bagi kita untuk mengetahui cara membaca informasi nilai gizi pada kemasan makanan dan minuman Dengan begitu kita bisa memperkirakan zat gizi apa saja yang kita dapatkan setelah mengkonsumsi makanan dan minuman tersebut

Pada kemasan MyMeal Catering juga dicantumkan label gizi agar customer paham kandungan gizi yang terdapat pada setiap porsi makannya
